# Things im working on and need to implement 


# Features 

##Â Minimum Valuable Product (v0). 

[] User Feedback
    - Once model has created a summary and created meta-data,   
        allow the user to edit these components before then inserting them into the vector database.

[] Document Comparison 
    - Given two documents comopare and contrast them.


[] Build front-end
    [] **Human in the loop :** User 

## Bells and Whistles
[] Scrape data from the web given a search query, and retreive those documents


## Complete

[Completed] [set: , completed-on : 06-07-2024] - Implement llama index retrival with ChromaDB. 


## To Do : 

[Priority] [Status] [Descrption]

[set :06-07-2024] Show me a list of all of my documents
[set :06-07-2024]  Show me a list of all of my collections
[set :06-07-2024] Allow me to look into a collection and get a summary of what is in there.


[] [set :06-07-2024] Improve retreival 
    Implement Hybrid Retreival usingBM25 and Reciprocal Rank

[]  [set: 06-07-2024] Imrpove document handling and upload process
    Create a way to look at all of the documents we have.
    We do not want to Rechunk and Re-idnex documents if they are already uploaded.


- [2] Make a pipeline to handle all data base related code. 

- [ in progress ] Implement the database related code as a singleton pattern.

- [2] Improve how we handle collections, this should be a singleton
     This is so that we only have one instance of a collection.

- [4] Add titles to the document object using the LLM. 
      Entry point -> Document.py
         class DocumentHandler().

- [2] Fix meta data on documents, currently meta data is only for chunks.
      Entry point -> Document.py
         class DocumentHandler().

- [3] Improve the current implementation of the Agents.
      Entry Point -> Agent.py

        [] Improve the configuration handling of agents.
        [] Determine the design pattern for agents and how they should fit into the application.
        [] Give agents conversational memory.

- [5] Can we create a runtime for agents? what does this even mean.

     So agents have an environment in which they exist and operate.
     This could be asyncronuse so they aren't just responding to 
     inputs from the user, but are constantly working and optimising outputs.

- [4] Testing.
    [] Write unit tests for document handler class.


- [5] Implement semantic chunking (Research dependent).


# Currently Working On : 

- [] **Working on llm and Agent Class**
            Agent.py
                working on the main function. I am working on defining an entry 
                point for the agent.So defining a set of tasks and thus an etry point for the language model


            What is the agent architecuture I should use here?

            I am currently using the babyAGI codebase to build my agent class 
 

# Bugs to Fix :
    [] - When logging, what is the really slow start up time?
    [] - Why are things running multiple times (Possibly because of the logger i am using)


# Thoughts and Ideas : 

- ** Markdown as structure ** 
     We want our documents to have structure. Should we get the LLM to 
     rewrite the document, keeping it as is , but adding structure VIA markdown?

-   How can we truly innovate here?
        Can we peice together multiple outputs?

- Take the Language models outputs and then feed this into a vector database and the language model can implement this into its planning
